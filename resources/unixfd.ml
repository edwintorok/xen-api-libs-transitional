(* Calling functions that may take locks inside a finaliser can lead to deadlocks,
   see https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/8794 and
   https://github.com/xapi-project/xcp-idl/pull/288.

   This can be worked around by running the finaliser code on a separate thread,
   however that needs lockless data structures for safety (Mutex and Event is not safe to use
   within a finaliser). Although I have code for this it is too complex/error-prone to be used
   for code that is rarely run.

   Instead have leak tracing only for Unix file descriptors where we print errors to stderr instead
   of using a logging library.
   This is similar to what OCaml already does by default, see [Sys.enable_runtime_warnings].
